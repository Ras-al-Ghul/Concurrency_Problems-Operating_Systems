#Problem 2

Compile and run `Problem2.c`

`Semaphores` have been used (as `mutex locks` too)

- ***MAXLANCS*** is the maximum number of Lancasters
- ***MAXYORKS*** is the maximum number of Yorks
- ***MAXRAND*** is the maximum value of the random number generated which is used while creating the warriors and while waiting in the inn.

The `number of Lancasters`, the `number of Yorks` and the `capacity of the inn` is taken as input.

- A thread is created and is `randomly assigned` to be a York or a Lancaster.
- The threads are created after `random intervals of time`.
- Also each warrior spends `random amount of time in the inn`.
