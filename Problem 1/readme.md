#Problem 1

Compile and run `Problem1.c`

`Semaphores` have been used.

- ***MAXRAND*** is the maximum value of the random number generated whose value is used in writing into the buffer.
- ***MAXBUFFERSIZE*** is the maximum size of the buffer.
- ***MAXREADER*** is the maximum number of reader threads.

This takes in `size of the buffer` and the `number of readers` as inputs.
Then a simulation is done.

The sole writer writes `loopvalue` times into the buffer.
