#Problem 4a

- The scripts in the `script files` directory are used to run the `perf` tests on `linuxdcpp`
- One needs to run just the script `datacollect.sh` which in turn runs the others.
- Be sure to change the `pid` of `linuxdcpp` in each of the scripts.
- The data is collected into log files stored in `log files` directory
- dat files are generated and stored in `dat files` directory and are used for generating the plots which are stored in `png files` directory
- `gnuplot` was used for plotting the graphs
